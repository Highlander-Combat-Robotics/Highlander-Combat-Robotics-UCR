The new repo for anything code and stuffs related
# ---
## Welcome to Highlander Combat Robotics!
This repo, like the name said, is to do the job of housekeeping all the software and code related stuffs related to the project
There will be some folders existing, as you may notice. They are:
* **Archive**: This is where the old files (docs) from the old repository are migrated over. I'm not sure of their purpose, hence why they lay here
* **Arena**: This is where sources code and documentation (if any) for the arena will be kept

The repo is rather small right now, so there are only two folders. If you want to create new folder in main, feel free to make a pull request, or better, post an issue and I (or a future maintainer) can do that.

Otherwise, happy hacking! Go make Doom run on your combat bot, he will murder your opponent
