# This is where all the arena stuffs are kept
Right now there are two seperate folder: Lights and Timer
* **Lights**: where the C++ source code for the Arduino lives
* **Timer**: where the Python source code for the timer lives

As of right now, the timer is missing... somewhere. Hence even though the code is there, I (as of 05/30/25) couldn't find the damn clock. Maybe in the future intergrating it into the Arduino is not a bad idea
